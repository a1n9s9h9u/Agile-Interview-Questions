## Agile Interview Questions

#### Agile Methodology

Agile Methodology, as the name suggests, is a set of methods and practices where software development and project management take place to deliver customer-centric products in a short development cycle known as sprints. It is an iterative approach and each iteration is specially designed to be small and manageable so that it can be delivered in a specific given period of time. Agile methodologies are open to changing requirements over time and encourage constant feedback from end-users. It is the most popular approach because, in this process, customers are also involved so that they can get updates regarding their product and also make sure whether or not they are meeting their requirements.

#### Re-factoring

Re-factoring is basically an activity that involves alteration or modification of the internal structure of software without any change in its external behaviors or functionality. In this, developers make some changes or tinker with code to enhance and improve the internal structure of software.

#### Sprint Backlog vs Product Backlog

Sprint Backlog: It is generally owned by the development team. It only contains those features and requirements that are related to the specific sprint only. It is considered a subset of the product backlog. It is compiled of everything that must be done to complete a particular sprint. It only includes items that can be completed during each agile sprint. It is specific to the sprint goal only in a particular sprint.

Product Backlog: It is generally owned and maintained by the project owner. It usually contains each and every feature of the product as well as the requirements of the product. It is compiled to everything that must be done to complete the whole process. It just breaks down every item into a series of steps. It is more specific to the end goal of the product.

#### Agile vs Traditional Software Development

Agile Software Development: It is an iterative approach that is used to design complicated software. In this method, project teams are allowed to be more flexible and ensure that the final is fulfilling the customer’s requirements. It develops customer-centric products and delivers in shorter sprints.

Traditional Software Development: It is a linear approach that is used to design simple software. In this method, all the phases of the process usually occur in sequence. It is more suitable for projects where the possibility of changes is negligible in the scope.

#### Velocity

A velocity is basically a measurement unit that measures or calculates how much work an agile development team can successfully complete in a single sprint and how much time will be required to finish a project. It is widely used as a calibration tool that helps development teams to create accurate and efficient timelines. It is also used to identify problems and measure the improvements that occur with time.

#### Daily stand-up meeting

A daily stand-up meeting is a day-to-day meeting among all the members of the agile team. Its main purpose is to know the current progress and performance of every team member that works on Scrum tasks. The meetings take place mostly in the morning and usually involves product owners, developers, and the scrum master.

#### Iterative vs Incremental Development

Iterative Development: It is basically a software development process where software development cycles (sprint and releases) are repeated until the final product is obtained. On the basis of feedback from customers or users, the product is again developed in cycles or releases and sprints i.e., adding new functionality in a repetitive manner. 

Incremental Development: It is basically a software development process where development works are sliced into increments or pieces or portions. In this, the software is developed and delivered in pieces or increments and each piece has a complete set of functionalities. The increment can either be small or large, and each increment is coded and tested fully. After testing each increment, they all are integrated so that they work as a whole. 

#### Product roadmap

A product roadmap, as the name suggests, is a powerful tool that describes how a product is likely to grow over time. It is a holistic view of product features that create the product vision. It also indicates what development is building, business goals that the new product will achieve, problems that the product will solve, etc. A product roadmap is owned by the product manager. It also encourages the development team to work together to achieve the desired goal for the successful delivery of the product.

#### Scrum

Scrum: There are different agile methodologies, and Scrum is one of them. It promotes accountability, function, and teamwork similar to Agile. In simple words, it is an improved way of Agile methodology and shares the same principles and values of Agile with adding some of its own unique features. 

#### Agile manifesto

The agile manifesto is basically a document consisting of values and principles that are expressed in Agile.

#### The 4 Agile Values  

Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools: It focuses on giving more attention and importance to communication with clients.

Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation: It focuses on the completion of the project and making sure that the project is completing the final deliverables.

Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation: It focuses on involving customers in all phases of the project so that the final product doesn’t lack any requirement that the client needs. It is done to ensure 100% customer satisfaction.

Responding to Change over Following a Plan: It focuses on changes and motivates the team to adopt the change quickly so that higher quality products can be delivered. Therefore, agile works in short sprints so that changes can be utilized for good.

#### The 12 Agile Principles 

Customer Satisfaction: First priority is to fulfill customer demands to ensure 100% customer satisfaction.

Welcome Change: Changes are important for improvement therefore even late in the development process, changes can be introduced and addressed throughout the development period.

Deliver Frequently: Products have to be delivered as soon as possible therefore focus on a shorter timescale.

Work Together: Both business stakeholders and team members work together through the development process for better collaboration.

Motivated Team: For delivering high-quality products, team members are motivated and encouraged. Team members are given the environment and support they need to perform effectively.

Face-to-Face:  Agile emphasizes Face-to-face communication which is the most effective and efficient way of conveying information. It helps the team to communicate simple and complex information in an effective way.

Working Software: Delivering working software to the customer is the major concern of Agile. Working software or product is the primary measure of progress towards the final product.

Constant Pace: Agile promotes sustainable development. All teams, sponsors, developers, and users that are involved in the agile process should maintain a constant speed to deliver working software in a short timescale.

Good Design: Focuses on good design and technical details to improve quality and agility (quick and graceful).

Simplicity: Team focuses on tasks and features that are essential and reduces the amount of work and time spent on complex features and tasks that are not essential. It is done to keep things simple.

Self-Organization: Agile team should be cross-functional and self-organized. It should not depend on the manager to assign work, instead should find their own work and manage the responsibilities and timelines. Such teams not only help to deliver good quality software but also provide the best designs, requirements, and architectures.

Reflect and Adjust: To improve the effectiveness of a team, the team reflects on how to become more effective and assess their working style at regular intervals. This is done so that one can learn from their mistakes and take some steps to improve their performance in the next iterations.

#### Sprint Planning vs Sprint Review Meeting

Sprint Planning Meeting: In this meeting, the discussion takes place about features and product backlog items (user stories) that are important to the team. This meeting is usually attended by the product owner, Scrum Master and Scrum Team. It is a weekly meeting and usually lasts for about an hour.

Sprint Review Meeting: In this meeting, the Scrum team gives a demonstration of the product. After this, the product owner determines which items completed and which are not completed. He also adds some additional items to the product backlog on the basis of feedback from customers or stakeholders. Its main aim is to inspect the product being created in the sprint and modify it if required.

#### Sprint Retrospective Meeting

Sprint Retrospective Meeting: This meeting takes place after the Sprint planning meeting. In this meeting, the Scrum team meets again to inspect itself and discuss the past mistakes, potential issues and methods to resolve them. Main aim of this meeting is to improve the development process.

#### There are basically three different roles in Scrum as given below:

Scrum Master: Scrum Master is basically a team leader or supervisor of a team who is responsible for ensuring that the scrum team executes committed tasks properly.

Product Owner: The product owner is basically a stakeholder of the project who is responsible for managing the product backlog. He is also responsible for defining a vision of what to build for the team.

Development Team: It involves an individual person and each person is responsible for working collectively to complete a particular project. It is the team that is responsible for developing actual product increments and meeting sprint goals.

#### There are three main artifacts of Scrum Framework:

Product Backlog: It is a list of all requirements from clients or stakeholders that are needed in the product and should be accomplished before the end of the project.

Sprint Backlog: It is a list of all finalized user stories, bug fixes, work items, etc., that are completed and selected by scrum to be completed during the current sprint.

Product Increment: It is the version of the end product derived from the completion of each Sprint.

#### Epic vs User story vs Tasks

Epic: It is basically a large story that cannot be completed in a single sprint. Therefore, epics are sub-divided into multiple, smaller user stories before they can be worked on.

User story: These are the smallest units that can be fitted and completed in one sprint. User stories are further broken down into different tasks.

Tasks: These are detailed pieces of work that are necessary to turn user stories into workable components.

#### Timeboxing

Timeboxing is an important time management technique or tool that is used to limit the amount of time that is being spent to complete a task. It simply allows a fixed unit of time for each and every task and this unit is known as a time box. The maximum length of the time box is 15 minutes. It not only helps to improve focus but also results in an increase in productivity. There are some events in Scrum and all these events are timeboxed which means all these events are allotted with a maximum and fixed unit of time for the task.

#### Scrum of Scrum

Scrum of Scrum, as the name suggests, is an Agile technique that involves meeting more than one scrum team and integrating the work of each team working on the same project. In simple words, it coordinates the work of multiple teams who need to work together to deliver complex solutions. In this meeting, members or representatives of individual teams share their high-level updates about their respective team’s work. Its main is to ensure coordination and integration of output from multiple teams by eliminating impediments if present.

## DevOps Interview Questions

#### DevOps

DevOps stands for Development and Operations. It is a software engineering practice that focuses on bringing together the development team and the operations team for the purpose of automating the project at every stage. This approach helps in easily automating the project service management in order to aid the objectives at the operational level and improve the understanding of the technological stack used in the production environment.

This way of practice is related to agile methodology and it mainly focuses on team communication, resource management, and teamwork. The main benefits of following this structure are the speed of development and resolving the issues at the production environment level, the stability of applications, and the innovation involved behind it.

#### Continuous Integration vs Continuous Testing vs Continuous Delivery

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that makes sure developers integrate their code into a shared repository as and when they are done working on the feature. Each integration is verified by means of an automated build process that allows teams to detect problems in their code at a very early stage rather than finding them after the deployment.

Continuous Testing (CT) is that phase of DevOps which involves the process of running the automated test cases as part of an automated software delivery pipeline with the sole aim of getting immediate feedback regarding the quality and validation of business risks associated with the automated build of code developed by the developers.

Using this phase will help the team to test each build continuously (as soon as the code developed is pushed) thereby giving the dev teams a chance to get instant feedback on their work and ensuring that these problems don’t arrive in the later stages.

Continuous Delivery (CI) is the process where some amount of manual intervention with the manager’s approval is needed for deployment to a production environment.

#### DevOps Pipeline

A pipeline, in general, is a set of automated tasks/processes defined and followed by the software engineering team. DevOps pipeline is a pipeline which allows the DevOps engineers and the software developers to efficiently and reliably compile, build and deploy the software code to the production environments in a hassle free manner.

#### IaC

As the name indicates, IaC mainly relies on perceiving infrastructure in the same way as any code which is why it is commonly referred to as “programmable infrastructure”. It simply provides means to define and manage the IT infrastructure by using configuration files.

This concept came into prominence because of the limitations associated with the traditional way of managing the infrastructure. Traditionally, the infrastructure was managed manually and the dedicated people had to set up the servers physically. Only after this step was done, the application would have been deployed. Manual configuration and setup were constantly prone to human errors and inconsistencies.

This also involved increased cost in hiring and managing multiple people ranging from network engineers to hardware technicians to manage the infrastructural tasks. The major problem with the traditional approach was decreased scalability and application availability which impacted the speed of request processing. Manual configurations were also time-consuming and in case the application had a sudden spike in user usage, the administrators would desperately work on keeping the system available for a large load. This would impact the application availability.

IaC solved all the above problems.

#### Blue-Green pattern

A blue-green pattern is a type of continuous deployment, application release pattern which focuses on gradually transferring the user traffic from a previously working version of the software or service to an almost identical new release - both versions running on production. The blue environment would indicate the old version of the application whereas the green environment would be the new version.

The production traffic would be moved gradually from blue to green environment and once it is fully transferred, the blue environment is kept on hold just in case of rollback necessity.
